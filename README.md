## Universities in the Intelligence Age

> A reference model university for the intelligence age.

> Students that are entering university today will finish in a vastly altered world.

### Status
- Research & Development
- Building simulations
- Building roadmap

### Scope
- Purpose / value of university to society with universal access to intelligence.
- Root of trust for society (Proof of Activity & Growth)
- Protocols
- Identity
- Trust
- A place to meet and socialise (social)
- Facilitate the social

### Docs
- [Litepaper](/docs/LITEPAPER.md)
- [Design](/docs/DESIGN.md)

### Processes
- Adminissions
- Learner Support
- Verification of Learning

### Outputs
- Protocol design
- Simulations ("The waves are crashing")
- Frameworks
- Kits for a practical response
- App with UX flow (as part of practical response):
    - Select skills you want to grow or from predefined templates based on domain.
    - AI Learning-Partner creates the templates for projects to grow the skills, [examples](/templates)
    - Work with AI learning-partner to support the learning/growth.
    - Physically socialise with other learners (University spaces) - including music etc 
    - Verify - as human learning-partners no longer deliver content, they verify learning via social conversations and observations based on templates for verification of growth/learning.  App helps with scheduling.
    - Issue Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) credentials based on verified achievements.
