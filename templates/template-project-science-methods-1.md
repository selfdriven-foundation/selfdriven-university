## Project Title  
**“Investigating Local Water Quality”**

---

## Overview  
You’ll investigate a nearby water source (like a pond or a local creek) to see how different factors (e.g., location, weather, or surrounding land use) affect water quality. By collecting samples, running tests, and analyzing data, you’ll walk through each stage of the scientific process—from forming a hypothesis to sharing your results.

## Project Steps  

1. **Formulate Your Research Question**  
   - Example: *“Does the water’s pH vary with distance from a storm drain?”*  
   - This introduces the **Scientific Method** (Skill 1) and encourages **Hypothesis Testing** (Skill 4).

2. **Design the Experiment**  
   - Decide which variables you’ll measure (pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc.).  
   - Plan how many samples you’ll collect and how often.  
   - This covers **Experimental Design** (Skill 2).

3. **Set Up Lab Safety Guidelines**  
   - Identify potential hazards (chemicals, slips in wet areas) and create a safety checklist.  
   - Demonstrates **Laboratory Safety** (Skill 5).

4. **Conduct Field Work**  
   - Collect water samples safely and record environmental conditions (weather, location).  
   - Involves **Critical Observation** (Skill 6) and **Field Work Techniques** (Skill 12).

5. **Data Collection**  
   - Measure water quality parameters (pH, temperature, turbidity) using proper tools.  
   - Keep notes in a structured data table.  
   - Addresses **Data Collection** (Skill 3).

6. **Analyze and Interpret Data**  
   - Input your measurements into spreadsheets or software for calculations.  
   - Use **Statistical Methods** (Skill 13) (e.g., mean, standard deviation) to interpret results.  
   - Apply **Analysis and Interpretation** (Skill 7).

7. **Visualize the Results**  
   - Generate graphs or charts (bar graphs, scatter plots) to spot trends.  
   - Demonstrates **Data Visualization** (Skill 9).

8. **Discuss Research Ethics**  
   - Consider permissions needed for sample sites and potential impact on wildlife.  
   - Talk about honesty in data reporting.  
   - Covers **Research Ethics** (Skill 11).

9. **Collaborate and Peer Review**  
   - Share your findings with classmates or colleagues.  
   - Ask them for feedback on your methodology and data interpretation.  
   - Practices **Peer Review** (Skill 10) and **Collaborative Research** (Skill 14).

10. **Create a Technical Write-Up**  
   - Summarize your methods, results, and conclusions in a clear, structured report.  
   - Incorporate charts, references, and disclaimers.  
   - Builds **Technical Writing** (Skill 8).

11. **Communicate Your Findings**  
   - Present your results to a group or create a short video explanation.  
   - Encourages **Communication of Findings** (Skill 15).

12. **Integrate Technology**  
   - Use digital tools for data logging, graph creation, or online collaboration (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel).  
   - Reinforces **Technology Integration** (Skill 16).

- The **Scientific Method** in action by creating and testing a hypothesis.  
- How to **Design** and **Conduct** an experiment from start to finish.  
- The ins and outs of **Lab Safety**, **Field Work**, **Data Collection**, and **Analysis**.  
- How to interpret data using **Statistics**, visualize it clearly, and get feedback via **Peer Review**.  
- Techniques for producing a thorough **Technical Report** and effectively **Communicating** your findings.  
- Ethical considerations in research and how to responsibly collect samples.  
- The role of **Technology**—from digital data-logging to creating polished visualizations.
